## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

To use Git Truck, you will need to have the following programs installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.13 or newer
- npm 6.14 or newer
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 2.29 or newer

To check if these programs are installed, and what version you have, run `node --version`, `npm --version` and `git --version`. If any of these are not installed on your system, or are just very old, they can be installed from the links above. Note that `npm` is installed along with `node`.
